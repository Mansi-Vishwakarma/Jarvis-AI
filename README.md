🤖 Jarvis AI – Python Voice Assistant
🔍 Project Overview
Jarvis AI is a voice-controlled virtual assistant built using Python. Inspired by the fictional assistant from Iron Man, this personal AI can perform a variety of tasks based on your voice commands—like opening applications, searching the web, telling the time, fetching Wikipedia summaries, and more.

This project demonstrates how speech recognition, text-to-speech, and automation libraries in Python can be combined to create an intelligent, hands-free experience.
